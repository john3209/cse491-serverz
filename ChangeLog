 * Made changes Homework 8 had us do. This includes:

 * Implementing command line options.

 * Running/setting up twill tests.

 * FOR MY PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:

 * I swiped one of the templates from oswd.org and used it in the imageapp.

 * I inserted the CSS stylesheet that I got from the OSWD template as an
   internal stylesheet in base.html. Therefore, every page would inherit
   from that style.

   changes can be seen in upload.html under images/templates.

 * Made changes Homework 10 had us do. This includes:

 * Implemented two projects.

 * FIRST PROJECT (5 Points):

 * Changed imageapp to support JPEG and TIFF. (#4)

 * I had to keep track of the image type along with the image data in
   image.py. Using that, I would change the content-type for each image
   request.

 * SECOND PROJECT (5 Points):

 * Add a URL that provides a list of images, resized to thumbnails. (#5)

 * First I had to create a new template (image_list.html) which included a
   jinja2 for loop to create the image tags. I also had to add a new function
   to root.py to handle the new web page request and to pass the image count
   to render method. Therefore, I had to create a method in image.py to get
   the image count and add a link to the index.html.

2014-04-08 Jeff Johnson <john3209@msu.edu>

 * Made changes Homework 11 had us do. This includes:

 * Integrated cookie app and set up its twill test.

 * Stores images in SQL database now. (The app automatically detects if the
   image table already exists so there is no special first time instructions.
 
 * Implemented two projects.

 * FIRST PROJECT (5 Points):

 * Make a thumbnail list using server-side resizing. (Used Pillow)

 * First you must install Pillow using "Pip Install Pillow". Also make sure
   that decoder libraries are installed. (Like libjpeg) The changes are under
   the root.py module where the a thumbnail image is returned. Instead of
   having the html image tag have a width and height, Pillow is used to
   manipulate the image before the data is returned.

 * SECOND PROJECT (5 Points):

 * Add image "metadata" uploading, storage, and retrieval. (Added
   Name/Description) Metadata only displays for index page and latest image
   page, not the image list.

 * First had to fix SQL table/inserts/retrievals. Then updated the image
   function parameters followed by the index, image, and upload templates. The
   name and description are uploaded in the form and displayed using the
   dictionary passed to the jinja render function.

2014-04-15 Jeff Johnson <john3209@msu.edu>

 * Made changes Homework 12 had us do. This includes:

 * Implemented two projects.

 * FIRST PROJECT (5 Points):

 * Add image metadata search.

 * This included two new html files (jinja2 templates), one of which took
   the image results information and looped through it. The new Sql command
   searches for the metadata using the "like" operator. The metadata is
   displayed with the images that match the user's criteria as well.
